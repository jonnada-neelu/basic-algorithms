1. Write an algorithm that calculates the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to a given number n.

Start
Input: Read the value of n
Initialize: Set sum = 0.
Loop: Iterate from 1 to n and add each number to sum. ( for i = 1, i <= n, i++)
return the sum
Output: Display the value of sum.
End

2. Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is a prime number or not.

Start
Input: Read the number n.
Check Special Cases: If 𝑛≤1 return Not Prime.
If 𝑛=2 return Prime (2 is the only even prime number).
Loop from if (n % 2== 0)
n is divisible by any number in this range, return Not Prime.
If no divisors found, return Prime.
End

3. Write an algorithm that takes three numbers as input and finds the largest of them.

Start
Input: Read three numbers a, b, c.
Compare the numbers: 
if a>=b, a>=c then a is largest, 
else if b>=c, b>=a then b is largest 
else c is largest
Output: Print the largest number.
End

4. Write an algorithm that calculates the factorial of a number n

Start
Input: Read a number n.
Check 
if n is 0 or 1: If yes, return 1.
Initialize factorial = 1.
Loop from 1 to n: Multiply factorial by each number in the loop.
Output: Print the computed factorial.
End

5.Write an algorithm that checks if a given number n is even or odd

Start
Input: Read the number n.
Check Condition:
If  n mod 2=0, print "Even".
Else, print "Odd".
